On a drizzly wet day in Scotland I was walking through a forest a this simple woodland trail caught my eye and was somewhat relaxing and so this picture was born. It works perfectly in the square format as the path leads your eye deeper into the forest.

Prints are printed on Hahnemühle photo rag paper, go to FAQ for more information about this paper.

This was shot on a Mamiya C220 with a 250mm lens on Fuji Pro 800Z film.
