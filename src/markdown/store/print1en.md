Enoshima is a really important location for us. It is a small little island in the Shonan region of Kanagawa with fantastic views along the coast towards mount Fuji. It is a particularly romantic location and there is something truly other worldly as the sun sets below the horizon with the iconic Mount Fuji defining the scene. I hope this image brings you joy, relaxation and wonder in the same way that day made us feel.
