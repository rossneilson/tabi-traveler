Enoshima is a really important location for us. It is a small little island in the Shonan region of Kanagawa with fantastic views along the coast towards mount Fuji. It is a particularly romantic location and there is something truly other worldly as the sun sets below the horizon with the iconic Mount Fuji defining the scene. I hope this image brings you joy, relaxation and wonder in the same way that day made us feel.
Prints are printed on Hahnemühle photo rag paper, go to FAQ for more informtation about this paper.
This was shot on a Nikon D5200 with a 35mm lens.
