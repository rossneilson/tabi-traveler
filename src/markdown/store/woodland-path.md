On a drizzly wet day in Scotland I was walking through a forest a this simple woodland trail caught my eye and was somewhat relaxing and so this picture was born. It works prefectly in the sqaure format as the path leads your eye deeper into the forest.

Prints are printed on Hahnem√ºhle photo rag paper, go to FAQ for more informtation about this paper.

This was shot on a Mamiya C220 with a 250mm lens on Fuji Pro 800Z film.
