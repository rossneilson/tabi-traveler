## About the print
On a drizzly wet day in Scotland I was walking through a forest a this simple woodland trail caught my eye and was somewhat relaxing and so this picture was exposed onto 10+ year old film (causing unique artefact in top corner). This was one of my favourite images from 2020. It works perfectly in the square format as the path leads your eye deeper into the forest.

Prints are printed on Hahnem√ºhle photo rag paper, go to FAQ for more information about this paper.

This was shot on a Mamiya C220 with a 180mm lens on Fuji Pro 800Z film.
