### How much does shipping cost?
Shipping on unframed prints are a flat £10 around the world. Framed prints are country specific and can be viewed individually on the product page.
### How long does shipping take?
Unframed prints are typically received within 3–5 working days. Canvas and framed prints are normally received within 5-7 days.
### How are products shipped?
Our unframed prints are hand rolled in protective tissue paper and then shipped in extra thick cardboard tubes.

All framed and canvas prints are wrapped in a protective sleeve with individual plastic or cardboard guards added to each corner. Additional cardboard is secured over the print surface to minimise the risk of breakages or transit damage. Each print is then shipped in a heavy duty cardboard box.

On those rare occasions when incidents do happen we strive to ensure that your collection and replacement are organised immediately and shipped back out on a priority service without any fuss.

## Printing
### What paper do you use?
We usually have an option between Hahnemühle paper and C-type silver halide paper for unframed prints. Standard framed prints use high quality enhanced matt art paper.
### What is the difference between papers?
Our C-type silver halide paper is a special process very similar to film that uses silver halide crystals, light and chemicals to make images. This results in super high quality prints, fantastic realistic colours, smooth tones while being long lasting. This process uses a fujifilm crystal archive paper.

On the other hand the Hahnemühle paper is a more standard Giclée print using ink. Despite this the paper is still of incredibly high quality as this paper manufacturer has been creating high quality paper out of Germany for hundreds of years. 
### Is it possible to change size or frame type?
Please contact me if you are interested in different sizes or different styles of frame.
